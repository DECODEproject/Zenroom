# Zenroom - crypto language VM

[![software by Dyne.org](https://github.com/decodeproject/zenroom/blob/master/docs/views/img/software_by_dyne.png)](http://www.dyne.org)

Zenroom is a brand new, small and portable virtual machine for cryptographic operations. The Zenroom VM has no external dependencies, is smaller than 2MB, runs in even less memory and is ready for experimental use on many target platforms: desktop, embedded, mobile, cloud and browsers (webassembly).

## Latest stable release is 0.6.0:

Zenroom is software in **ALPHA stage** and is part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

This software aims to make it easy and less error-prone to write **portable** scripts using **end-to-end encryption** inside isolated environments that can be easily made **interoperable**. Basic crypto functions provided include primitives to manage **a/symmetric keys, key derivation, hashing and signing functionalities**.

Zenroom is software inspired by the [language-theoretical security](http://langsec.org) research, it allows to expresses cryptographic operations in a readable scripting language that has no access to the calling process, underlying operating system or filesystem.

Zenroom's **restricted execution environment** is a sort of [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28computer_security%29) whose parser is based on LUA's [syntax-direct translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax-directed_translation) and has coarse-grained control of computations and memory. The Zenroom VM is designed to "brittle" and exit execution returning a meaningful message on any error.

Zenroom's documentation and examples are being written to encourage a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) approach to scripting, providing functional tools to manipulate efficiently even complex data structures.

The main use case for Zenroom is that of **distributed computing** of untrusted code where advanced cryptographic functions are required, for instance it can be used as a distributed ledger implementation (also known as **blockchain smart contracts**).
