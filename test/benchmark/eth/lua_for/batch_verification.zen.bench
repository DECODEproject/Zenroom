Scenario 'ethereum': batch verification

Given I have a 'ethereum address array' named 'ethereum addresses'
and I have a 'ethereum signature array' named 'ethereum signatures'
and I have a 'string' named 'message'

When I verify the 'message' has an array of ethereum signatures in 'ethereum signatures' by 'ethereum addresses'

Then print the string 'OK'
