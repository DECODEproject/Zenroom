# iOS library build

This directory contains all files needed to use Zenroom on the iOS
mobile phone platform.

An example of application using Zenroom and running natively on both
iOS and Android is https://github.com/DECODEproject/decode-app

The header and code files in this directory are additional wrappers
needed, together with the `src/zenroom.h` "internal" header file and
the static libraries build for Android and made available on Github
releases or on https://files.dyne.org/zenroom
