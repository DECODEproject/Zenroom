Scenario ecdh: Verify the Identity signature
Given I have a 'public key' from 'Authority1234'
and I have a 'string dictionary' named 'Identity'
and I have a 'string dictionary' named 'HistoryOfTransactions'
and I have a 'signature' named 'Identity.signature'
and I have a 'signature' named 'HistoryOfTransactions.signature'
When I verify the 'Identity' has a signature in 'Identity.signature' by 'Authority1234'
When I verify the 'HistoryOfTransactions' has a signature in 'HistoryOfTransactions.signature' by 'Authority1234'
Then print the string 'Signature of Identity by Authority1234 is Valid'
and print the string 'Signature of HistoryOfTransactions by Authority1234 is Valid'
