Scenario pvss
Given I have a 'base64' named 'pvss s'
Given I have a 'integer' named 'pvss total'
Given I have a 'integer' named 'pvss quorum'
Given I have a 'pvss public key array' named 'pvss participant pks'
When I create the pvss public shares of 'pvss s' with 'pvss total' quorum 'pvss quorum' using the public keys 'pvss participant pks'
Then print the 'pvss public shares'
and print the 'pvss quorum'
and print the 'pvss total'
