Scenario 'ecdh'
Given I have a 'ecdh' public key from 'Alice'
and I have a 'string' named 'message'
and I have a 'ecdh signature' named 'ecdsa deterministic signature'
When I verify the 'message' has a ecdh signature in 'ecdsa deterministic signature' by 'Alice'
Then print the string 'Signature is valid'
and print the 'message'
